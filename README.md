### Generate a Schedule

Clone and navigate into the repository. Then, install dependencies:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

You can either output the iCal to console with:

```bash
$ bin/ical
```

Or you can save it to a file in the `out` folder with:

```bash
$ bin/download_ical
```

Enter your desired filename when prompted (sans extension or path, ex. `abstractions.1.0` to get `out/abstractions.1.0.ics`) and press Enter.

You'll find your output in `out/<filename>.ics`.

## TODO

- [ ] Cache API responses so I don't hit the endpoint âˆž times
- [ ] Cache the iCal until the API response changes
